# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.

#  sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))


# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.

# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.

# directories to ignore when looking for source files.
# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.

# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.

# so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".

# or fully qualified paths (eg. https://...)

# If true, figures, tables and code-blocks are automatically numbered if they have a caption.

# The LaTeX builder always assigns numbers whether this option is enabled or not.
